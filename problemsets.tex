\homework{1}{graph-iso-variants}
{
We will reduce variants of graph isomorphism problem to the original problem.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item We defined the graph rigidity problem {\sc GR} as - given a graph $X$, test if $Aut(X)$ is trivial. Show that {\sc GR} $\le$ {\sc GI}.
\item Notice that the {\sc GI} is defined for undirected graphs. Define the graph isomorphism problem for directed graphs {\sc DirGI}. Show that {\sc DirGI} $\le$ {\sc GI}.
\end{enumerate}
}

\homework{1}{tree-isomorphism}
{
Design a linear-time algorithm that takes two rooted trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ as input and tests if they are isomorphic. Note that an isomorphism between $T_1$ and $T_2$ must preserve edges as well as parent-child relations.
}

\homework{1}{normalizer-normalclosure}
{
Let $G$ and $H$ be subgroups of $S_n$. Give a polynomial (in $n$) time algorithm which given the generators of a group $G$, and $H$, write down algorithms for:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Checks if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
\item Normalizer of $H$ in $G$. That is the largest subgroup of $G$ in which $H$ is a normal subgroup.
\item Normal closure of $H$ in $G$, that is the smallest normal subgroups of $G$ that contains $H$.
\end{enumerate}
}

\homework{0}{newman-tightbound}
{
We stated in class that for any $n > 3$, every subgroup of $S_n$ can be generated by at most $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ elements. Show that this bound is tight by giving an example of an $\Omega$ and a group $G \le S_{|\Omega|}$ acting on it such that $G$ requires $\frac{|\Omega|}{2}$ elements to generate it. (Hint : Consider $\Omega = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m, b_1, b_2 \ldots b_m \}$).
}

\homework{1}{primite-actions}
{
Let $G$ act transitively on $\Omega$. In class, we showed a characterization of primitive actions. Extend the argument to show the following. Let $\alpha \in \Omega$. Let $\Gamma$ be the set of all blocks $B$ which contain $\alpha$ and set $\mathcal{H}$ be a set of all subgroups of $H \le G$ that contain $G_\alpha$. Establish a bijection between $\Gamma$ and $\mathcal{H}$.
}

\homework{1}{commutator-subgroup}
{
For any group $G$, the commutator subgroup $G'$ of the groups, sometimes denoted by $[G,G]$, is defined as,
\[ [G,G] = \{g_1g_2g_1^{-1}g_2^{-1} \mid g_1, g_2 \in G \} \]
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Argue that $G/G'$ is an Abelian group. (That is $\forall a,b \in G/G'$, $ab = ba$)
\item Show that $G'$ is the smallest group such that (a) holds.
\item Give a polynomial time algorithm for the following problem : Given a generating set for $G$, compute that of $G'$. (Hint : Use one of the previous algorithmic problems in this set).
\end{enumerate}
